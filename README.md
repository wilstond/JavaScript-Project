JavaScript Project by Team Epiphany

Create a fictional restaurant website.  
The website is to contain the following pages/features/functionality:  
 A Home page – as a group, determine the best content for this page 
 About Us – information about the restaurant and parent company, including
history, etc. 
 Contact Us – contact form for the user to fill out and send information to the 
head offices/restaurant location. 
 Gift Cards – Allows the user to fill out a form for a customized gift card for 
friends/family/etc. 
 Locations – A listing (include maps) of locations of the restaurants. 
 Menu – a full menu, including breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, drinks, dessert 
and buffet. 
 Events / Booking – A page listing information about holding events at the 
location which includes a sign up form to complete if they wish to have one at 
their restaurant. As well, information about events previously held at their 
restaurant. 
 Careers – job opportunity page listing the locations and opportunities at the 
locations. 
 Site Map – a map of the website 
 Daily/Weekly/Monthly Specials – a menu page with information on specials 
 Contests – rigged contest that the customer never wins….no plugin to be used 
for this feature. 
The website must have a header and footer on the page that does not change as the user navigates 
from page to page. 
The footer will include copyright information, a contact us email, rss subscribe feed, twitter and 
facebook icons. (no actual links required.) 
Any and all content should be fictional, but not lorem ipsum.
Besides jQuery, no external libraries are allowed (no Bootstrap or Foundation et cetera).
Evaluation sheets must also be submitted.
